                          <section>
                          <p>
                          Ubiquitous music (ubimus) can be described
		as a research/practice area where music intersects with
		various fields of knowledge: computer science,
		acoustics, signal processing, psychology, cognition, education, etc.                     
                          </p>
                          </section>
                          <section>
                          <p>
                          Its origins lie in the extension of the
                          concept of ubiquitous computing (Weiser 1991) to
                          music, and the notion that technologies
                          tend to recede to the background and become
                          invisible.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                          However, while this served as a jumping
                          point, ubimus developed outwards to incorporate
                          many other ideas and working methods

<h3>Software Archaeology</h3>
<p> <em>"This isn’t programming, this is archaeology!" the programmer
                          complained, wading through the ancient
                          rubble of some particularly crufty piece of
                          code. </em> <br> (Hunt and Thomas,
                          <em>Software Archaeology </em>, 2001) </p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Along with other products of human activity, software as artefacts can 
be subject to archaeological study.</p><p>
As noted by Hunt and Thomas
(2001), a piece of code can be taken as a legacy object almost as soon
as it is written. </p><p>
Understanding software, and learning from it, may even be
an active aspect of working with an existing codebase that is
continuously maintained.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>
Just as in other forms of archaeology, we should develop techniques to
handle and study code in a very careful and non-destructive way.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
We
should try to learn from the motivations and decisions taken in the
design of a piece of software.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
We should refrain from immediate reactions
such as "what in the hell where they thinking", but try to discover
something about the frame of mind of the creators of the code we are
looking at.

<h3>Ubimus Archaeology (a-ubimus)</h3>

<section>
<p>
Beyond the techniques and methods of software archaeology lies the
field of <em>ubimus archaeology</em>, or a-ubimus (Keller and
Lazzarini 2021).
</p><p>
Here we are interested in recovering and
reconstructing various related artefacts (software, hardware, audio,
documentation, etc) and tracing the ideas that
led to these, also taking into consideration the context, material
resources and byproducts related to ubimus activities.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
The study of a-ubimus has several cross-concerns: for instance, we can
speak of the archaeology of creative resources, the archaeology of
creative models, and the archeology of creative ecosystems.
</p><p>
While it
has emerged only recently as a distinct field of research, it has
a number of important precendents.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Among these we could cite <p>
<ul "font-size:80%;">
<li> the work of Zattra et al (2007) in the
reconstruction of Chowning's <em>Stria</em>, as an example
of rescuing the materials and ideas associated with a key artefact of
  Computer Music. </li>
<li>
 Reconstructed versions of classic computer
music packages (MUSIC V, CMusic, mit-ems Csound) were offered as part of my
<em> Audio Programming Book</em> (MIT Press, 2010) is also a precendent that
led to work in a-ubimus. </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<ul "font-size:80%;">
<li> A detailed studied of music programming
systems in Lazzarini (2013) is also representative of
early work in a-ubimus.
</li>
<li>
More recently, the work of Frances Morgan (2021) on the Electronic Music Studios
(EMS) of London can also be placed within the scope of a-ubimus.

<h3> Case Study: Reconstructing Risset's <em>Little Boy</em></h3>
<p> To demonstrate an instance of a-ubimus research, we will examine
a recent work reported in Lazzarini et al (2023). </p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Jean-Claude Risset's <em>Little Boy Suite</em> is an example
from the early computer music period (1961-9).
</p><p>
Composed using
MUSIC V for sound synthesis, it was assembled out of various
rendered fragments into a complete work on magnetic tape.
</p><p>
This is a work whose sources were deemed to be lost, and
as part of our research, we were able to recover them.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
To accomplish the reconstruction, we were required to
<ul "font-size:80%;">
<li>Recreate a working copy of MUSIC V as used by Risset (a replica)</li>
<li>Recover the MUSIC V code (scores) used to realise the
sounds in the piece </li>
<li>Identify the use of the fragments in published versions
of the work 
</li>

<h3> Methodology </h3>
<ul style="font-size:80%;">
<li>
Use version control
</li>
<li>
Respect the original code; use comments to help preserve original
code; additions/modifications only made in extreme cases.
</li>
<li>
Do not assume the code runs (and runs as intended) just because it
compiles and builds. <br>
</li>
<li>
Capture snapshots of it in operation, using tracing, checking outputs
against expected results.
</li>
<li>
Cross-compare different sources.

<H3>Results &amp; Discussion </H3>
</section>
<section>
<H3>MUSIC V versions</H3>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
The a-ubimus approach demonstrated that many alternative
versions of MUSIC V existed.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
Variations were customised by composers to better suit
their work or a particular piece.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
We have preserved the various uncovered versions of the software
using modern versioning control.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<H3>Re-evaluating Contributions</H3>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
As part of this process, we were able to re-evaluate
contributions to the development of computer music,
correcting the historical record
</p>
<ul style="font-size:80%;">
  <li> Frequency modulation (FM) synthesis was first explored by James
  Tenney in the period of 61-4, using noise as modulator.</li>
  <li>
  We found the earliest extant code fragment of sinusoidal FM (by
  Risset), which precedes John Chowning's paper by around 5 years. 
  </li>
  <li>
  We traced the development of feedback amplitude
  modulation (FBAM) by Risset, and
  reconstructed the Fortran source code of a FBAM
  unit generator by F.R.Moore (which had been lost).
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<H3>Working Environment Dynamics</H3>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
We have been able to explore the dynamics of the work at
Bell labs and the interaction between composers and engineers/scientists.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
It is interesting to note that while many interests where shared,
there were differing opinions/perceptions regarding the use of
computer technology for musical ends.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<H3>Precision?</H3>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
We were also able to question the myth of precision that arose
in early computer music.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
While it is true that sound synthesis was much more reproducible
that in the analogue studio, many variables still existed.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
In particular, all sources had to be decoded and recorded
into magnetic tape, prior to editing/mixing. That challenged
the idea of a fully precise process.
</p>
</section>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<section>
<H3>A-ubimus Contributions</H3>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
Research in a-ubimus can contribute to an understanding of
music, techniques, technologies, and the creative environment
around these.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
It can allow re-use of lost software/hardware in new
musical applications.
</p>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
It can also teach today's practioners lessons about the
development of the tools of their trade.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<H3>Applications</H3>
<ul style="font-size:80%;">
<li> Reconstruction of lost musical works.
  </li>
<li> Recovering of techniques and artefacts for music making.
</li>
<li> A re-evaluation of the emergence and
development of musical practices.
</li>
</ul>  
</section>
<section>
<H3>Digital Humanities</H3>
<p style="font-size:80%;">
A-ubimus has a strong connection to research in
the Digital Humanities. Many of the approaches and
methods can find common ground. It is of course
directly related to cultural archaeology, and
it would be useful to explore these connections
further.
