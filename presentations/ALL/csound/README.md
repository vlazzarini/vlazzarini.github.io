## Introduction 

This repository contains a Csound user-code library for live coding. The library may be used:

* by \#including the livecode.orc file in your own project,
* by running livecode.csd to initialize and start a live coding session on the desktop,
* by loading http://live.csound.com in any browser that supports WebAudio and WebAssembly.

Further documentation is available in the [doc folder](doc/intro.md).
