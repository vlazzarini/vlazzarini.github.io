Earlier in March, I released a single with Aman Jagwani on drums based
on an arrangement of the Mahavishnu Orchestra's track *Meeting of the
Spirits*. This is the story behind the arrangement and recording.

This composition is very typical of the style and sound
McLaughlin was developing with the Mahavishnu. It was a very original
take on Jazz-Rock, or fusion, which was only nascent at the time.
Particularly important in this piece, I think, are the influences from
Indian Classical music, particularly in terms of rhythm and in the
modalism adopted. From that perspective, it is possible to note the
use of a particular raga from the Melakarta, *Hanumatodi* (S R1 G2 M1 P
D1 N2 S), and a pentatonic sub-set from it. The rhythm structure is,
for the most part, based on a 5+5+2 pattern, which is also described
by the Carnatic tala *Khanda Jati Matya*. The tempo is lightning fast,
which was typical of many of his pieces.


First Version
------

Last year was John McLaughlin's 80th birthday and it occurred to me to
make a recording of one of his classic compositions. I had already
done a version of his 11/8 12-bar blues *Follow your Heart*, which was
itself a re-recording of *Arjen's Bag* originally from *Extrapolation*
of 1969, but now I wanted to tackle something else. It was actually a
choice between *Birds of Fire* and *Meeting of the Spirits*, which
were very close in format. Both were Mahavishnu (mark I) tracks with
rolling arpeggio figures and slightly odd rhythmic patterns. I went
with the latter, which seemed to provide a bit more scope to do what I
wanted.

My idea was, following from the earlier recording to do a
multitrack/multiscreen video in order to capture all the parts (bar
the drums, which I could not play and would not want to replace with a
programmed part). For this, I recorded several overdubbed audio parts,
capturing some of these on video too. Then I mixed these down and
recorded an improvised synth solo on top of it, also filming it.

Following this, I prepared a final mix of the audio. To complete the
project, I just had to edit the video parts into a multiscreen film
and sync them up with the recorded audio parts. The result then went
into youtube and I used it as my intro video for the channel.

For this arrangement, I did a number of changes from the
original. First of all, I removed the introduction, which would not
have worked without the drums. The main tune structure was also
modified slightly. In the original, following the statement of the
theme there is a guitar solo. Then the theme returns complete with its
tag where the arpeggio pattern is replaced by a few sustained
chords. The piece continues with an electric piano solo. Towards
the end of it, there's a fast background figure played in unison by
guitar and violin. We're then back at the beginning: after eight bars
the theme comes back followed by the tag. The track finishes with
the arpeggio figure going into a long fade out over which a short
violin solo is played.

In my version, I played first the theme complete with the
tag, and then followed it with a solo. This was finished off with
the full theme and tag, ending with the arpeggio pattern fading out.
This made my version a lot shorter, but it made sense given that
it was a keys only recording and I did not want to stick in another
synth or piano solo. I was happy with the result and left it at that.

Second Version
------

Towards the end of last year, I recorded some ideas as a demo, which,
later on in January, I developed into a track called *The Singing
Wind*. I then asked Aman Jagwani if he was interested in recording
drums for it. We went into the studio and in a short session laid the
drums for the track. I did a rough mix of the recording and it was then floated
about on the internet, where it got some traction. This led me to
finish the mix, master it and make a release, which you can listen to here:

The experience led me to consider what else we could do. I showed my
version of *Meeting* to Aman and he agreed to add drums to it. Now I
had a stronger proposition. I could work out a more complete
arrangement, adding back in the parts I had left out. So I reused
parts of my earlier version like the electric piano, bass synth and
string machine parts, as well as the synth solo, but restructured the
arrangement completely, re-recording and adding many other keyboard
parts.

While in the earlier recording I had proceeded in a fairly traditional
way, using the DAW simply as if it were a multitrack recorder with
little editing bar fade outs, now I started making cuts and move
things about to accommodate the new recorded parts and the new
arrangement.

I recorded a guide for the intro, playing the chords on the piano
(which was not used in the final mix), and inserted it at the start.
Then I overdubbed several parts to re-create the introduction in
a rich-sounding way. The first part them followed more or less like in my original
recording, but I added a number of background parts to fill it
up and make it stronger sounding.

For the second part, I had the electric piano starting the arpeggions
on its own, with each part entrying in a gradual build up, at the end
of which I inserted the background figure that I had not used in the
first version. This was played on three parts, a double-track synth
and a fast-leslie organ. From this I went straight into the theme and
tag. In the original, there is an eight-bar space between the end of
the background figure and the theme re-exposition. It did not make
sense to have it here since I had prepared this whole build up and so
following up with the theme was to me the right thing to do. 

The second part was designed as the background for a solo by the
drums. So when we went down to the studio to record Aman's part,
he was able to take advantage of the build up to structure it. I
thought it was particularly brilliant the way he did this leading to
a really explosive ending with the theme. The coda of the track was
then very similar to my earlier version with a short fade out.

Following the recording session, I took my time to listen and to mix
it properly. I wanted to achieve a sort of vintage sound for the
drums, which I think was helped by the minimalist way we tracked
these: a stereo microphone overhead plus another for the kick drum.
Some work in the mixing/mastering allowed me to get the sound I
wanted. You can judge for yourself here,

Video
-----------

Since I had a completely new track with a much stronger arrangement,
it made sense to revise the video so that it could be linked to the
release. The trouble was that I did not have footage for the drums
recording or for any of the new parts I had re-recorded and added this
year. So I decided to re-cut the video to match the first part, which
was possible to do, and fade out at the start of the drums solo
(basically a 'single cut' of the track). The intro had come out so
well in the master that I decided to keep it and place it under the
title, syncing the text with the first strike of the chords.
